The locks directory is used for locking of files and objects
within the parent directory. The files in this directory are always of zero
length and are removed when the corresponding objects or files in the parent
directory are removed by Modus. This locks directory itself is removed
when Modus is removing all files for the circuit associated with the parent
directory.
