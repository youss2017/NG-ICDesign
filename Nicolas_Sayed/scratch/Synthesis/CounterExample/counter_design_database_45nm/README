I.      Course Title:

        5.0 Cadence RTL to GDSII - Course Database

II.     Course Developer:

        Pamula Sai Srinivas pamulasa@cadence.com

III.    Minimum Hardware Requirements:
	Make sure you have installed all the software needed for these labs. 
	Look up the hardware (HW) requirements for the software from 
	http://downloads.cadence.com 

	For some software, you can also run checkSysConf <RelName>.
	To see a list of software that allows checkSysConf, use 
	checkSysConf -r

	We do not require parallel processing for these labs, but a parallel processing step 
	might require additional setup and HW.

	Lab requirement - retain at least 500 MB for the course 
	duration for saving of intermediate files and designs.

IV.     Software Products Required:

	An X-Window environment is required to run the software.
        
	This course uses the following software:
		Xcelium Simulator (XCELIUM2209)
		Integrated Metric Center (VMANAGER2203,XCELIUM2209)
		Genus Synthesis Solution (GENUS221)
		Encounter Test or Modus (MODUS221)
		Conformal Logic Equivalence Checker (CONFRML222)
		Innovus Implementation System (INNOVUS221)
		Tempus Timing Signoff Solution (SSV221)
		Voltus Power Signoff Solution (SSV221)
		Quantus RC Extraction (SSV221)

        Software reference Manuals are available online at http://support.cadence.com.

V.      Loading and Set Up of Database
	Once you have the database, make sure that the files inside are complete and not corrupt.
	If it is a tar,gz, you will have to:
	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>
	OR
	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

	If it is a tar.Z, you have to:
	uncompress <filename.tar.Z>
	and then,
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

	If it is a zip file, use:
	unzip <filename.zip>

VI.     Setting the tool installation Paths:

	>Open the cshrc file from  counter_design_database_45nm  directory

	>Replace your installation paths of each tool with a string <tool_installation> in the file cshrc


	For example: 

		setenv XLMHOME <tool_installation>/xcelium/2209/22.09.001

        If your tool path is this "/home/tools/install/XLS22/xcelium/2209/22.09.001/tools/bin" for the Xcelium Software. 
	
	Then replace <tool_installation> with "/home/tools/install/XLS22" in cshrc file like as shown below.
	
		setenv XLMHOME /home/tools/install/XLS22/xcelium/2209/22.09.001


        >Source the cshrc without any errors.

	Typically the cshrc file set the paths of all the tools used in this course.
