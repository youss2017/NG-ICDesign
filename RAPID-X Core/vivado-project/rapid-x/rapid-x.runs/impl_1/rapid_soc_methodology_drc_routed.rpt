TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks lcd/mux/selectClockDivider/out_clk and ext_pll_in are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu_clk_div/n_0_1880_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu_clk_div/n_1_2237_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.
