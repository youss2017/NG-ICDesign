        Project Objectives:  Describe the project objectives that will help achieve the goals of the project. Please be as specific as possible.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Phase 1</b>
            </li>
                Design an ASIC implementing the RISC-V RV32I base instruction set, except for memory ordering and environment/system calls.
                <ul>
                    <li>Perform functional and/or formal verification of the design to confirm functionality of the design. Use the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) standardized methodology. Target a minimum of 85% code coverage.</li>
            <li>Synthesize the hardware description language into a netlist for physical layout. Target the 45nm FreePDK45 technology using the Nangate open cell library.</li>
            <li>The design should be capable of processing 100 million instructions per second (100 MIPS) within the operating range of 0.95-1.25V and 0-125Â°C and consume a maximum of 1W. Additionally, the design should incorporate an L1 cache of at least 16MB.</li>
            <li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Test the performance and system-level functionality of the design by creating and executing test cases in RV32I assembly.</li>
            <li><b>Phase 2</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finalize functional and/or formal verification of the design, adhering to the target code coverage.</li>
            <li>Use electronic design tools to perform physical design and create a layout of the design.</li>
            <li>Conduct static timing analysis (STA), IR drop, and electromigration analysis to ensure physical performance requirements are met. Target a maximum IR drop of 5% with no timing failures and maximum current density within limits.</li>
            <li>Use physical design techniques such as design rule checking (DRC) to establish design manufacturability and layout versus schematic (LVS) to ensure correctness of the physical design.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stretch goals</b>
                <ul>

                    <li>Perform gate-level simulation to verify the design with real clock delays.</li>
                    <li>Use logic equivalence checking to validate the functional equivalence between different stages of the development process.</li>
